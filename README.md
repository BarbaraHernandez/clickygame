## About this Application:

This application uses React.JS and Yarn.

The goal of the game is to click through all images without repeating any.

Players should be able to click on images to earn points. After each click the images shuffle into random order to increase difficulty. If a user clicks an image with a state of clicked, this should end the game. If a user has already clicked all but one image and successfully selects the last unclicked image, they will win the game. In both cases the game shoud restart. In addition to the game score, prompt text should change based on whether the user has chosen correctly or not.
