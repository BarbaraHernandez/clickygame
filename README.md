## About my Code:

This application uses react, yarn, and ES6.

Players should be able to click on images to earn points. After each click the images shuffle randomly to increase difficulty. If they click an image with a state of clicked, this should end the game. If a user has already clicked all but one image and successfully selects the last unclicked image, they will win the game. In both cases the game shoud restart. In addition to the game score, prompt text should change based on whether the user has chosen correctly or not.
